# SFSU_CSC690_FinalProject
This is the final project for CSC 690 at SFSU
The premise is simple: There is a video game called Icarus, which allows for players to harvest materials and build things in an open-world environment. There are hundreds of items which you could build, but only a certain number of them will be allowed for you to use. To plan out which items you want to be able to build, this app will have a copy of the "Tech Tree" from the game, as can be seen at the link below:

  Go to TECH (BW7), then to PLANETARY
